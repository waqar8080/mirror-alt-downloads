## 🔑 Smart Mirror Downloading—How It Works

Leveraging the latest in artificial intelligence, Mirror Download Companion uses both **OpenAI GPT** and **Claude** APIs to crawl, filter, and validate alternative download references. This ensures you’re never left waiting for a slow or failing server. The app uses adaptive search terms and contextual analysis to avoid false positives and maximize relevant hits, including niche or partially indexed file sets.

*Example:*  
You request a multimedia file. The engine automatically invokes the AI search, targets the best repositories, selects the optimal mirror based on real-time server analytics, and initiates download—resuming across any network disruption.
